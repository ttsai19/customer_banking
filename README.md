# Customer Banking System

## Overview

This project is a simple customer banking system that calculates and tracks interest earned on savings and CD (Certificate of Deposit) accounts. The program allows users to input account details such as balance, interest rate, and number of months, and it calculates the updated balance and total interest earned.

## Features

- **Savings Account Functionality**: Calculates interest earned on savings account balance and updates the balance.
- **CD Account Functionality**: Calculates interest earned on a Certificate of Deposit (CD) account balance and updates the balance.
- **User-Friendly Prompts**: The user is prompted to input account details (balance, interest rate, and months), and the program calculates and prints the interest earned and updated balance.
